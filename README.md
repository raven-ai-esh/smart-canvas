## Key capabilities

## Core concepts
- 📌 Cards: tasks or ideas with text, status, and clarity.
- ➡️ Links: directed lines showing impact from one node to another.
- 🌊 Energy: a priority signal that flows across links and highlights what matters.
- 🗂️ Sessions: separate workspaces for projects or teams.
- 👥 Participants & mentions: involve the right people without noise.

## Quick start inside the product
1) Create a session and name it after your project.

3) Connect the elements that influence each other.
4) Pick 1–2 focus zones and enable monitoring.
5) Ask Raven AI to sharpen wording and suggest next steps.

## Where Raven delivers the most value

## Raven AI
